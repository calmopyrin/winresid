To patch VICE to use reSID for sound in x64, do the following:

1. Install reSID (see the resid INSTALL file for instructions)
2. Unpack vice-0.14.2.tar.gz
3. Apply the supplied patch using GNU patch,
   e.g. if vice-0.14.2 and resid-0.1 are both located in /usr/tmp
     cd /usr/tmp
     patch -p0 < resid-0.1/vice/vice-0.14.2-resid.diff
4. Configure VICE with the --with-resid option
     ./configure --with-resid
5. Make and install VICE
6. Run x64 and enjoy!
