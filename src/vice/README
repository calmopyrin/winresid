This is a patch for VICE 0.14.2 to use reSID for sound in x64.
VICE 0.15 has support for reSID, however the SID writes are not cycle exact
(yet) to avoid the annoying frequency variations in the patch for VICE 0.14.2.
Until this is fixed VICE 0.14.2 is still the reference test environment for
reSID. If possible please double check any SID tune in VICE 0.14.2 before
submitting a bug report on reSID.

Note:
1. A processor comparable in speed to a Pentium II is needed for this.
2. Turn off "Enable adaptive playback"; this sounds awful.
3. Selecting "SID Model"/"8580 (new)" makes no difference.
4. Turn "Emulate SID filters" off if you have problems with speed.
