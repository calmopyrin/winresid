This is a patch for VICE to use reSID for sound in x64.

Note:
1. A processor comparable in speed to a Pentium II is needed for this.
2. Turn off "Enable adaptive playback"; this sounds awful.
3. Selecting "SID Model"/"8580 (new)" makes no difference.
4. Turn "Emulate SID filters" off if you have problems with speed.
