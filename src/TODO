* Improve combined waveforms.

* Implement pulse samples.

* More C64 filter measurements. The audio output stage in the C64 is not
  modeled. This does high-pass filtering and may have audible effects.

* Write documentation. Possibly a paper describing how SID was reverse
  engineered.

* Implement a SID tune player. Put on ice because of the SIDPLAY support.
