Changes in reSID version 0.2
----------------------------

The implementation of the Envelope Generator has been rewritten to handle
the infamous ADSR delay bug. All known envelope related bugs have been
corrected.

The maximum filter resonance is lowered to keep the filter stable.

The reSID API has been simplified. Reading write only registers is allowed.
