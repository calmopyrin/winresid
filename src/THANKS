reSID was written by Dag Lem.

The project was started after reading an interview with Bob Yannes, the
head engineer of the SID chip. This interview was done by Andreas Varga,
and can be found on his SID Homepage:
http://stud1.tuwien.ac.at/~e9426444/sidpage.html
The reverse engineering of the SID chip would not have been possible without
this interview.

Also found on the SID Homepage is an examination of the SID noise waveform
written by Asger Alstrup. This article was of great help in reverse
engineering the complete algorithm for the noise waveform.

Lars Haugseth has been invaluable in the testing of reSID.
In a matter of hours after hearing about my project, he had completed a 6510
disassembler in Perl. The importance of this was not evident to me
until the next day when he had disassembled the music routine for
"Outrun Remix" by Geir Tjelta, made some changes to it, reassembled,
and produced a file containing 48K of SID register values.
The first tests of reSID were run on this file.
With an exceptional memory of Commodore 64 tunes Lars Haugseth has pointed
out several errors in reSID that are now corrected.

Morten Rollan and Kåre Gunnar Nesheim provided interesting discussions
regarding audio filters.

VICE has been an inspiration for this project, and testing of reSID has
been greatly simplified by VICEs -sounddev dump option. This package includes
a patch file for VICE to use reSID for sound in x64. Information on VICE can
be found at:

Finally I would like to thank my business partner Stian W. Arnesen for
putting up with all this nonsense.
